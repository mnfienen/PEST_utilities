Several Utilties are included
################
# recRipper.py #
################
This code parses a REC file from PEST and puts out
files to investigate the evolution of PHI over iterations.

The two output files are: basename.rec_tphi, which is to 
show total phi over iterations, and
basename.recout, which shows PHI components in the form that
can be used with Google plotting for "bubble charts".
Bubble Charts are also called Google Motion Charts:

################
# plot_bpas.pt #
################
This code plots parameter values for each value over iterations in the
<basecase>.bpa.# files. The <basecase>.bpa file is ignored.

Output is <basecase>_parvalues.pdf with a page for each parameter.
