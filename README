uberPEST.py

a m!ke@usgs joint
contact: Mike Fienen <mnfienen@usgs.gov>

This project is a wrapper around PEST (although generalizable) that 
uses gmail protocols to send an email upon completion of a PEST
or (more often) beoPEST model run.

The dependencies are: gmail_sender.py and a config file the *must* be named uberPEST.par.

An example ubserPEST.par file is included.

This code uses gmail to send the email out, so the user must set up an account
at gmail.com. The login name of the account <myaccount>@<gmail.com> gets listed in the
parameter file (in this example, it is: wwsc.modeling.center@gmail.com). The code securely
prompts for the password.

Elsewhere in the parameter file (uberPEST.par), variables are generally read from the start of the line 
to the first whitespace. All other text on the line is treated as a comment and ignored. An exception to 
this rule is for the PEST flags line in which all information (including whitespace) up to the "#" comment
indicator is read and used in the model call.

On lines where "none" is listed as an option, simply type "none" without quotation marks.
